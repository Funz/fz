# R Interpreter Test File - Vector Operations
# Tests R's vector operations and sequence functions

#@# Create sequences and vectors
#@x <- seq(1, $max_val, by=1)
#@y <- seq($start, $end, length.out=$n_points)

Vector Operations:
Input range: 1 to $max_val
Sequence start: $start, end: $end, points: $n_points

Statistics on x:
- Sum: @{sum(x)}
- Product: @{prod(x)}
- Length: @{length(x)}
- Mean: @{mean(x)}

Statistics on y:
- Min: @{min(y)}
- Max: @{max(y)}
- Range: @{diff(range(y))}
