## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fz.git
   cd fz
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Funz/fz.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- `bc` command (for running tests on Linux/macOS)

### Install Development Dependencies

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install fz in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pip install pandas  # Optional but recommended

# Install system dependencies (Linux/macOS)
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install bc

# macOS:
brew install bc
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Run tests to ensure everything is working
pytest tests/ -v

# Check that fz is importable
python -c "import fz; print(f'FZ version: {fz.__version__}')"
```

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Stable releases
- `develop` - Development branch (if used)
- `feature/your-feature-name` - Feature branches
- `fix/your-fix-name` - Bug fix branches

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Commits

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add support for XYZ calculator

- Implement XYZ protocol
- Add tests for XYZ
- Update documentation

Fixes #123"
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_parallel.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=fz --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest tests/ -k "parallel" -v
```

### Writing Tests

All new features should include tests. Place tests in the `tests/` directory.

Example test structure:

```python
import fz
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path

def test_your_feature():
    """Test description"""
    # Arrange
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        input_file = Path(tmpdir) / "input.txt"
        input_file.write_text("Parameter: $param\n")

        model = {
            "varprefix": "$",
            "output": {"result": "cat output.txt"}
        }

        # Act
        results = fz.fzr(
            str(input_file),
            {"param": [1, 2, 3]},
            model,
            calculators="sh://bash script.sh",
            resultsdir=str(Path(tmpdir) / "results")
        )

        # Assert
        assert len(results) == 3
        assert all(results['status'] == 'done')
```

### Test Requirements

- All tests must pass on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Tests should be isolated and not depend on external resources
- Use temporary directories for file operations
- Clean up resources after tests

## Code Style

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- Maximum line length: 127 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes

### Formatting

```bash
# Format code with black (optional)
black fz/ tests/

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 fz/ --max-line-length=127
```

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Brief description of function.

    Longer description if needed, explaining the purpose,
    behavior, and any important details.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2

    Returns:
        Description of return value

    Raises:
        ValueError: When param2 is negative

    Example:
        >>> result = example_function("test", 42)
        >>> print(result)
        {'key': 'value'}
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Pull Request Process

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Overview

```
fz/
â”œâ”€â”€ core.py       # Main API functions (fzi, fzc, fzo, fzr)
â”œâ”€â”€ interpreter.py     # Variable parsing and formula evaluation
â”œâ”€â”€ runners.py    # Calculation execution (local, SSH)
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers.py    # Parallel execution and retry logic
â”œâ”€â”€ io.py         # File I/O, caching, hashing
â”œâ”€â”€ logging.py    # Logging configuration
â””â”€â”€ config.py     # Configuration management
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Core functions** (`fzi`, `fzc`, `fzo`, `fzr`) should remain stable
2. **New calculator types**: Add to `runners.py`
3. **New interpreters**: Add to `interpreter.py`
4. **New features**: Consider backward compatibility

### Performance Considerations

- Use generators for large datasets
- Avoid loading entire files into memory
- Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- Optimize hot paths

### Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize shell commands
- Warn about insecure operations (e.g., SSH passwords)
- Never commit credentials or sensitive data
